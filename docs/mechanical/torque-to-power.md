# Torque to Power Calculation
This is a calculator to calculate power from torque and rotational speed.  

For inputs of Torque and rotational speed, the user can choose from the dropdown list the unit readings from sources, be it nameplate or measurements.  

Eg: when you enter "100 Nm" as an input, you can then switch the unit to "lb-in" and the same quantity will be shown as "885.1 lb-in", until you change the input value.  

Similarly, "2 HP" can be shown as "1.491 kW", or "149.1 W", until you change the input value.
